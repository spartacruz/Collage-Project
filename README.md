All about my college project (C Language)



Welcome to my repo!


In this repo, you'll found all my C programming exercise. Mostly came from my lecturer assignment.

These programs are meant to help others get started quicker on their own projects and also help them understand certain coding techniques and ideas. Feel free to branching, use or modify whole / part of code.

Also, if you need more detail on certain code, giving some feedback, ~~or giving donation~~ dont hesitate to contact me by email.

Have a nice day!



*ps : All comments in code is written in Indonesian Language (Bahasa Indonesia), I will do my best to translate it in english. You may use google translate or contact me for further assistance*

*pss : Some of commit was lost because I'm forcing push*
